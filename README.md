# SeedTray

SeedTray is a convention-based approach to page specific Javascript.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'seed_tray'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install seed_tray

In application.js, require seed_tray *after* the rest of your JS is included.

``` javascript
//= require turbolinks
//= require_tree .
...
//= require seed_tray
```

Add the data attributes to your `<body>` element
```
<body <%= page_data_attr %>>
    <%= yield %>
</body>
```

## Usage

SeedTray makes a couple assumptions about how you will organize your code.

You need to create a object to represent your app with the same name as your
Rails app. SeedTray will automatically use this object as the root of your view
classes.

You must add an object for each controller#action combination for which you
want to provide custom javascript.

For example, let's say your Rails app is called `Fruit`. You need to have a
`fruit.js.coffee` in `assets/javascript`.

Let's say you have a controller named `BananasController` with actions `index` and `show`. You will need to add three objects in `bananas.js.coffee`:

* `Fruit.Bananas`

* `Fruit.Bananas.Index`

* `Fruit.Bananas.Show`

In each of these objects, you need to implement the `render` method:

### Coffeescript:

In `app/assets/javascript/bananas.js.coffee`
``` coffeescript
class @Fruit.Bananas
    @render: ->
        # Custom coffeescript to run on every action

class @Fruit.Bananas.Index
    @render: ->
        # Custom coffeescript for bananas#index

class @Fruit.Bananas.Show
    @render: ->
        # Custom coffeescript for bananas#show
```

If you want some coffeescript to run site wide:

In `fruit.js.coffee`

``` coffeescript
class @Fruit
    constructor: ->
        Fruit.delegator.site_wide_render = ->
           # Do something
```

### Javascript ES2015

In `app/assets/javascript/bananas.(js, es6)`
``` javascript
Fruit.Bananas = class {
  static render() {
    // Custom Javascript to run on every action
  }
};

Fruit.Bananas.Index = class {
  static render() {
    // Custom Javascript for bananas#index
  }
};

Fruit.Bananas.Show = class {
  static render() {
    // Custom Javascript for bananas#show
  }
};
```

If you want some Javascript to run site wide:

In `fruit.(js, es6)`

``` javascript
class Fruit {
  constructor(){
    Fruit.delegator.site_wide_render = function (){
      // Site wide JS
    };
  }
}

```
___

**HEADS UP:** Make sure your application object (`Fruit` from our
example) is added before the rest of your code or else, you will get an
undefined error.

To finish the install, instantiate the app object in applications.js if you
defined any methods or data on it:

``` javascript
new Fruit();
```
This is particularly important if you intialize the `site_wide_render`
method in the object's constructor. `SeedTray` must have added the `delegator`
before you attempt to set the value.

Add the data attributes to the
``` html
<body <%= page_data_attr %> >
  ...
</body>
```

`page_data_attr` puts data attributes with the controller and action on your
page. For example, if you were visiting /bananas/1, you'd get:

``` html
<body data-controller='Bananas' data-action='Show' >
  ...
</body>
```
### Console Suppression

By default, SeedTray will write to your browser's console when a script is executed or skipped.  Depending on your Javascript driver in your test suite, these messages may show in your testing console as well.

To suppress these messages, simply add the following to the appropriate `config/environments/` file.

``` ruby
SeedTray.configure { |config| config.suppress_console = true }
```

## Events

Since SeedTray executes after a document's `ready` event fires, there are several events attached to `document` provided at various stages of the rendering cycle.

#### Global:

Upon rendering of any given action within any given controller, the event `seedtray:render` is fired.  Eg:

``` javascript
$(document).on('seedtray:render', function(){ ... });
```

#### Controller:

Upon rendering of any action within a given controller, the event `seedtray:<controller>:render` is fired.  Eg:

``` javascript
$(document).on('seedtray:bananas:render', function(){ ... });
```

#### Action:

Upon rendering of any given action, the event `seedtray:<controller>:<action>:render` is fired.  Eg:

``` javascript
$(document).on('seedtray:bananas:show:render', function(){ ... });
```

#### Please Note:

Since the events are fired in the order `sitewide -> controller -> controller#action`, each class only has access to it's event and any proceeding events (IE `controller` can access the `controller#action` delegation event, but it cannot access the `sitewide` delegation event)


## Namespaced Controllers

A controller named `Admin::Dashboard` becomes `Admin_Dashboard` in the convention.
More generally, `module/word_word_controller` becomes `Module_WordWord`. We replace
the scope operator with an underscore and CamelCase the controller name. See the
[helper definition](https://github.com/LoamStudios/seed_tray/blob/master/lib/seed_tray/data_attribute_helper.rb#L3)
for the exact details.
