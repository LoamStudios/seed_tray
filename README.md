# SeedTray

SeedTray is a convention-based approach to page specific Javascript.

## Dependencies

SeedTray depends on jQuery 1.3+

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'seed_tray'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install seed_tray

In application.js, require seed_tray *after* the rest of your JS is included.

``` javascript
//= require jquery
//= require jquery_ujs
//= require turbolinks
//= require_tree .
...
//= require seed_tray
```


## Usage

SeedTray makes a couple assumptions about how you will organize your code.

You need to create a object to represent your app with the same name as your
Rails app. SeedTray will automatically use this object as the root of your view
classes.

You must add an object for for each controller#action combination for which you
want to provide custom javascript.

For example, let's say your Rails app is called `Fruit`. You need to have a
`fruit.js.coffee` in `assets/javascript`.

Let's say you have a controller named `BananasController` with actions `index` and `show`. You will need to add three objects in `bananas.js.coffee`:

* `Fruit.Bananas`

* `Fruit.Bananas.Index`

* `Fruit.Bananas.Show`

In each of these objects, you need to implement the `render` method:

### Coffeescript:

In `app/assets/javascript/bananas.js.coffee`
``` coffeescript
class @Fruit.Bananas
    @render: ->
        # Custom coffeescript to run on every action

class @Fruit.Bananas.Index
    @render: ->
        # Custom coffeescript for bananas#index

class @Fruit.Bananas.Show
    @render: ->
        # Custom coffeescript for bananas#show
```

If you want some coffeescript to run site wide:

In `fruit.js.coffee`

``` coffeescript
class @Fruit
    constructor: ->
        Fruit.delegator.site_wide_render = ->
           # Do something
```

### Javascript ES2015

In `app/assets/javascript/bananas.(js, es6)`
``` javascript
Fruit.Bananas = class Bananas {
  static render() {
    // Custom Javascript to run on every action
  }
};

Fruit.Bananas.Index = class Index {
  static render() {
    // Custom Javascript for bananas#index
  }
};

Fruit.Bananas.Show = class Show {
  static render() {
    // Custom Javascript for bananas#show
  }
};
```

If you want some Javascript to run site wide:

In `fruit.(js, es6)`

``` javascript
class Fruit {
  constructor(){
    Fruit.delegator.site_wide_render = function (){
      // Site wide JS
    };
  }
}

```
___

**HEADS UP:** Make sure your application object (`Fruit` from our
example) is added before the rest of your code or else, you will get an
undefined error.

To finish the install, instantiate the app object in applications.js if you
defined any methods or data on it:

``` javascript
var app = new Fruit();
```

Add the data attributes to the
``` html
<body <%= page_data_attr %> >
  ...
</body>
```

`page_data_attr` puts data attributes with the controller and action on your
page. For example, if you were visiting /bananas/1, you'd get:

``` html
<body data-controller='Bananas' data-action='Show' >
  ...
</body>
```

### Console Suppression

By default, SeedTray will write to your browser's console when a script is executed or skipped.  Depending on your Javascript driver in your test suite, these messages may show in your testing console as well.

To suppress these messages, simply add the following to the appropriate `config/environments/` file.

``` ruby
SeedTray.configure { |config| config.suppress_console = true }
```


## Events

Since SeedTray executes after a document's `ready` event fires, there are several events attached to `document` provided at various stages of the rendering cycle.

#### Global:

Upon rendering of any given action within any given controller, the event `seedtray:render` is fired.  Eg:

``` javascript
$(document).on('seedtray:render', function(){ ... });
```

#### Controller:

Upon rendering of any action within a given controller, the event `seedtray:<controller>:render` is fired.  Eg:

``` javascript
$(document).on('seedtray:bananas:render', function(){ ... });
```

#### Action:

Upon rendering of any given action, the event `seedtray:<controller>:<action>:render` is fired.  Eg:

``` javascript
$(document).on('seedtray:bananas:show:render', function(){ ... });
```


## Namespaced Controllers

A controller named `Admin::Dashboard` becomes `Admin_Dashboard` in the convention.
More generally, `module/word_word_controller` becomes `Module_WordWord`. We replace
the scope operator with an underscore and CamelCase the controller name. See the
[helper definition](https://github.com/LoamStudios/seed_tray/blob/master/lib/seed_tray/data_attribute_helper.rb#L3)
for the exact details.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run
`rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive
prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To
release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run
`bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push
git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to
[rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
